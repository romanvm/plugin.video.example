# Simple example plugin for Kodi mediacenter

This is a simple yet fully functional example of a video plugin for [Kodi](http://kodi.tv) mediacenter.
Please read the comments in the plugin code for more details.
An installable .zip can be downloaded from "[Releases](https://github.com/romanvm/plugin.video.example/releases)" tab.

**Note**: the purpose of this example plugin is to show you how to organize and play your media content in Kodi.

are beyond the scope of this example.

The plugin uses a pre-defined set of free sample videos from [www.vidsplay.com](http://www.vidsplay.com/).
