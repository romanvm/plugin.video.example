# Simple example plugin for Kodi mediacenter

This is a simple yet fully functional example of a video plugin for [Kodi](http://kodi.tv) mediacenter.
Please read the comments in the plugin code for more details.
An installable .zip can be downloaded from "[Releases](https://github.com/romanvm/plugin.video.example/releases)" tab.
Do **not** try to install a .zip generated by GitHub.

**Note**: the purpose of this example plugin is to show you how to organize and play your media content in Kodi.
The methods of obtaining such content, for example parsing websites or working with various APIs,
are outside the scope of this example.

The plugin uses a pre-defined set of public domain movies from  [publicdomainmovie.net](https://publicdomainmovie.net/).

If you are working with this code in some IDE, like PyCharm or VS Code, I strongly recommend to install
[Kodistubs](https://github.com/romanvm/Kodistubs) in your working Python virtual environment
to get auto-completion and quick documentation for Kodi Python API classes and functions in your IDE.

**Warning**: the "master" branch is only compatible with Kody 20.0 ("Nexus") and above that uses Python 3
runtime for addons. For older versions see "matrix" and "python2" branches.
